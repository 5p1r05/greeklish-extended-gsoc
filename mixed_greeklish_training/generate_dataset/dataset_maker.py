    """
    This function takes a list of original Greek sentences, and converts them to Greeklish, using the conversions
    stored in the dictionaries above. Each time a token in a sentence has more than 1 possible conversions (for example,
    Î· -> {h, i} ), the sentence branches into two (or more, depending on the amount of possible conversions) new
    sentences, equivalent up to that point, and the translation continues independently for each branch. This ensures
    that each possible way to convert a sentence to Greeklish gets an equal representation in the resulting dataset.
